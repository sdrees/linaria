# `2.0` Migration Guide

## Breaking changes

### `Core-js` dependency removal and _theoretical_ drop compatibility for `node` below `10`

In [#569](https://github.com/callstack/linaria/pull/569) We removed `core-js` dependency.

It should not effectively affect your users or build pipelines. But it was technically a breaking change.

We set babel preset that makes all non-browser dependencies compatible with `node` from version `10`. But previous setup was using `browser` env so If you was able to build Linaria with previous versions of node, it should work also now. Support for browsers environment didn't change.

After that you should be able to solve issues with `core-js` dependency in your project, because it will no longer collide with version used by Linaria.
